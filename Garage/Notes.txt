##Summary

###Output
The ultimate output is the display of a graphic on a Rhino drawing.
The graphic gives a colour representation of temperature [and humitity]
from sensors at various locations as indicated in the Rhino drawing.
This requires the Rhino .3dm file with a representation of the building
and locations of the sensors. It also requires a database of the sensors'
temperatures  [and humidity] readings and associated times.

The important intermediate file is the (SQLite) database file. 
This is used by a Grasshopper program ('extractSensorIDLocations.ghx')
which uses a python script ('extractSensorReadingsSliceSQLite.py')
to access the database.

###Inputs

###Process
- `SensorIdHash.txt` is manually edited based on which sensor is plugged 
      into which module and socket.
- `SensorRecordOuput*.txt` files are generated by python program 
     `SensorRecord` running on base station(s). These need to be
     transferred to another computer for processing.
- `All_data.txt` is made from multiple recorded file as below.
- `All_data.csv` is converted from `All_data.txt` by python 
      program `SensorDataReformat`.
- 'sensorLocations.txt' is generated from Rhino drawing with Grasshopper
     program detailed in 'extractSensorIDLocations.ghx'
- `SensorReadings.db` is generated from files `All_data.csv` and 
      'sensorLocations.txt' using python programs `loadSensorReadingsSQLite`
       and `loadSensorIDlocationsSQLite`.
- Temperature bubbles are viewed in Rhino drawing using Grasshopper program
      'extractSensorIDLocations.ghx' which uses python 
      script 'extractSensorReadingsSliceSQLite.py' to get data 
      from `SensorReadings.db`.

##Details

Data currently is from three recording basestations, so lots of duplication.
Duplicates are not exact because the time stamps created by different 
base stations differ very slightly. 
Also, errors in reception may occur on one base station and not on others.

Put it everything in SQL then we will see if it needs to be filtered to remove duplication.

1/ Edit SensorIdHash.txt as necessary for any new sensors installed.
    NEED TO ADD MORE MODULES TO SensorIdHash.txt

2/ Put everything in one file (in dir raw_data) do:

cat SensorRecordOuput10.txt  >All_data.txt
cat SensorRecordOuput11.txt >>All_data.txt
cat SensorRecordOuput12.txt >>All_data.txt
cat SensorRecordOuput13.txt >>All_data.txt
cat SensorRecordOuput14.txt >>All_data.txt

cat SensorRecordOuputC44.txt >>All_data.txt
cat SensorRecordOuputC45.txt >>All_data.txt

cd ../
mv raw_data/All_data.txt   All_data.txt  # or eg   All_data_2026-01-19.txt

2/ Filter and convert module & J# to sensor ID. In dir Garage do :
     ../RecordData/SensorDataReformat --infile='All_data_2026-01-19.txt' \
            --SensorHash='SensorIdHash.txt' --outfile='All_data_2026-01-19.csv' 
test file
     ../RecordData/SensorDataReformat --infile='test_data_2026-01-19.txt' \
            --SensorHash='SensorIdHash.txt' --outfile='test_data_2026-01-19.csv'  --debug=True 

3/ Load csv files into SQLite db:
     ../DisplayData/utils/loadSensorReadingsSQLite \
        --infile='All_data_2026-01-19.csv' --outdb='SensorReadings_2026-01-19.db'
     ../DisplayData/utils/loadSensorIDlocationsSQLite \
        --infile='sensorLocations.txt' --outdb='SensorReadings_2026-01-19.db'
test file
     ../DisplayData/utils/loadSensorReadingsSQLite \
        --infile='test_data_2026-01-19.csv' --outdb='test_2026-01-19.db'
